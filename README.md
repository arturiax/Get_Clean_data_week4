# Get_Clean_data_week4
## Getting and cleaning data course final assignment

This repository is the final project for the John Hopkins University Getting and Cleaning Data Course from Coursera.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

From the messy data of the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) we need to construct a final tidy data set with the average of some variables for each activity and each subject.

The code to get the final tidy data set is in `run_analysis.R`. The scrip has comments that explains all the steps done.

The `Codebook.md` file contains the descriptions of the variables.
